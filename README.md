# Unified Resolution Model (URM)

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:**  
This work is under active development. It is shared for academic and collaborative purposes only and may evolve significantly. Use at your own discretion.

The **Unified Resolution Model (URM)** is a theoretical framework proposing that leading approaches to quantum gravity — such as **Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG)** and **M-theory** — represent different observational resolutions of a single, underlying multidimensional reality.

This repository contains the **conceptual foundation**, **mathematical formulation**, and **simulation code** that together form a scalable, testable model for understanding **dimensional emergence**.

## 🧠 Core Ideas

- **Resolution Parameter (ρ):** A continuous scalar representing observational fidelity, energy scale, or information density.
- **Lens Operator (L̂ρ):** A projection operator that filters observable structure depending on resolution.
- **Dimensional Emergence:** As ρ increases, additional spatial dimensions become observable through continuous transitions.
- **LQG and M-Theory Unified:** Spin networks in LQG may represent low-resolution projections of high-dimensional brane structures described by M-theory.

## 🧪 Simulation Code

This repository includes a C# console application that simulates resolution-dependent dimensional emergence:

- 📈 Smooth transitions in **D(ρ)** from 4D to 11D using sigmoid or power-law mappings.
- 🧩 Lens projections reveal growing state complexity as resolution increases.
- 🧱 Modular architecture prepared for future extensions (e.g. tensor networks, holographic mappings).
