# Unified Resolution Model (URM)

The Unified Resolution Model (URM) is a theoretical framework proposing that leading approaches to quantum gravity — such as Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) and M-theory — represent different observational resolutions of a single, underlying multidimensional reality.

This repository contains the conceptual foundation, mathematical formulation, and simulation code that together form a scalable, testable model for understanding dimensional emergence.

## 🧠 Core Ideas

- **Resolution Parameter (ρ):** A continuous parameter representing observational fidelity, energy scale, or information density.
- **Lens Operator (L̂ρ):** A projection function that reveals different physical phenomena depending on resolution.
- **Dimensional Emergence:** As ρ increases, additional spatial dimensions become observable through smooth transitions (not discrete jumps).
- **LQG and M-Theory Unified:** Spin networks from LQG may be low-resolution projections of string/brane structures in M-theory.

## 🧪 Simulation Code

This repository includes a C# console application that simulates dimensional emergence based on the model’s lens and resolution parameters.

- **Shows how D(ρ)** smoothly transitions from 4D to 11D using sigmoid functions.
- **Lens projection** reveals state complexity that increases with resolution.
- **Modular architecture** with support for future tensor network modeling.
